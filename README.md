## **Project Background and Context**

SpaceX has established itself as a leader in the commercial space industry by significantly reducing the cost of rocket launches. The company charges $62 million for a Falcon 9 launch, a fraction of the $165 million charged by other providers. This cost-efficiency is largely due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the rocket's first stage.

## **Problems Analyzed**

1. **What determines whether a rocket will land successfully?**

2. **Which variables have the greatest influence on the landing success rate?**

3. **Can we estimate the cost of a launch by predicting whether the first stage will land?**
